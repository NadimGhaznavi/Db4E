# Mining Monero XMR

This is the home of **db4e**, the **Database 4 Everything**  project. The **db4e** application aims to provide a simple *Terminal User Interface* (TUI) to setup and operate a Monero XMR Mining farm on one or multiple computers. This project is still under development.

# Features Today

*db4e*:

* Monitors the health of your farm with a [console based dashboard](/pages/ops/db4e-gui.py.html)
* Manages a (free) GitHub Pages website (e.g. [my mining farm](https://xmr.osoyalce.com)) where *db4e* publishes reports
* Includes a mini Python install containing required 3rd party software (e.g. PyMongo)7
* A [MongoDB Backend](#mongodb-backend) for historical data, logging and configuration settings

The [https://xmr.osoyalce.com/] site is generated by the *db4e* application. It houses live data from a small Monero XMR Mining farm.

# Web Reports

Reporting with *db4e* is easy. A reports definition file tells *db4e* what kinds of reports to prepare.

* Reports are automatically published to the GitHub website
* Reports are defined in a simple YAML file (e.g. [sharesfound.yml](/conf/reports/sharesfound.yml))
* Reports can be scheduled (e.g. [pool hashrate](https://xmr.osoyalce.com/reports/hashrates/Pool-Hashrate-60-Days.html))
* Some reports in *db4e* are event driven (e.g. [recent payments](https://xmr.osoyalce.com/reports/payments/Daily-Payment-60-Days.html) reports)
* Reports can be run manually

The [Reports](https://xmr.osoyalce.com/pages/Reports.html) page has links to currently configured reports from my small farm.

# MongoDB Backend

The *db4e* stands out from other Monero XMR software in that it includes a **MongoDB Database** to house historical data, logs and configuration settings. The *db4e* application is setup as a system service. When running it monitors the local P2Pool software and creates records in MongoDB. MongoDB houses the data used to generate the [reports](https://xmr.osoyalce.com/pages/Reports.html) and as a data source for the [db4e console application](/pages/ops/db4e-gui.py.html).

# Technology Stack

The *db4e* application is currently running on [Debian Linux](https://www.debian.org/) and is made up of a number of components:

* The [core db4e code](https://github.com/NadimGhaznavi/db4e)
* A [P2Pool daemon](/pages/ops/Building-P2Pool-from-Source.html)
* A (free) website hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/)
* A [MongoDB server](/pages/ops/Installing-MongoDB.html) 

At it's core, *db4e* monitors the P2Pool server for events. Scheduled commands are also sent to the running P2Pool daemon to trigger log output. Events are stored in MongoDB. Some events also trigger the creation of a CSV file which is published to a GitHub hosted website (this site). Javascript code is used to render the CSV data into nice, human-friendly graphs and bar charts.

See the [Pre-Requisites page](/pages/ops/Pre-Requisites.md)

# Systems Architecture

The application is designed to be modular and have a clear data abstraction layer. Mining database operations go though a *mining
database class* which sends those to a *db4e mining class* which interacts with MongoDB.

For example, mining data exports to CSV are performed by connecting to the *MiningDb* class which connects to the *Db4eDb* class which connects to MongoDb and fetches the data.
