title: db4e-gui.py Console Application
---

The `db4e-gui.py` provides a realtime console based GUI to display health and performance information about my Monero XMR Mining farm. I run the application continuously to keep an eye on things.

The application displays the following timestamped information:

* My monero XMR mining farm's wallet balance.
* The hashrate of each cryoptocurrency miner.
* A pane showing the past 11 XMR payments made to the farm.
* A pane showing the past 14 share found events made by the miners.
* An ASCII display of the current share position(s) within the PPLNS (*Pay per last N-Shares*) window.
* The hashrate of the main Monero XMR blockchain.
* The hashrate of the Monero XMR mini sidechain.
* The hashrate of my Mining farm pool.
